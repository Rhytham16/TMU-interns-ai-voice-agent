# 🎙️ TMU Interns AI Voice Agent

Welcome to the official documentation for the **AI-Powered Voice Agent** developed by interns at **Teerthanker Mahaveer University (TMU)**.  
This intelligent system is designed to interact with users through **natural voice-based conversations**, enabling efficient document search and query resolution using modern AI technologies.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project combines **speech recognition**, **natural language understanding**, and **vector-based document retrieval** to create a smart assistant capable of understanding and responding to user queries via voice.

The assistant uses:
- 🗣️ **Voice input & output**
- 🤖 **FastAPI** backend to manage requests
- 🧾 **LangChain + ChromaDB** for document parsing and vector-based search
- 🔗 **OpenAI APIs** or other LLMs for generating natural responses

## ✨ Key Features

✅ Voice-based interaction  
✅ Document ingestion with real-time querying  
✅ Fast and scalable FastAPI backend  
✅ Semantic search using embeddings  
✅ Easy to deploy and extend
